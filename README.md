<h2>System Overview</h2>

The objective of this task was to design and implement a functional and well-structured system while demonstrating solid programming fundamentals. The solution was built with a strong focus on clean architecture, logical data flow, and code readability. Each component was designed to have a clear responsibility, allowing the system to remain scalable and easy to maintain. The overall structure reflects an approach that could be extended or adapted for more complex scenarios.

<h2>Thought Process During the Task</h2>

During the development process, my approach was intentionally more creative than strictly procedural. I chose to implement most of the core logic from scratch, deliberately avoiding the use of pre-made packages or existing solutions whenever possible. While I was aware that this decision could slow down development, my intention was to demonstrate my logical reasoning, problem-solving skills, and ability to write clean, self-contained code.

By building the system manually, I aimed to show a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics rather than relying on external tools. This allowed me to make conscious design decisions and maintain full control over the structure and behavior of the code, even under time constraints.

<h2>Personal Assessment</h2>

I am not completely satisfied with the final result, as my original goal was to complete the task earlier and fully cover every requirement described in the assignment. The decision to avoid external packages slowed down development more than I initially anticipated. I am confident that, had I used existing tools or packages, I would have been able to complete all requested features in less time than estimated.

That said, I am pleased with what I was able to achieve within the limited timeframe. I believe the resulting codebase is solid, clean, and well-structured. The visual and aesthetic aspects of the project also took more time than expected, which impacted overall progress. While additional comments could have improved readability in some areas, I am satisfied that the implementation demonstrates a strong foundation and a professional development approach.
